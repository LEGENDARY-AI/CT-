<div class="Story">
 <p>Standing in unison, Ghana’s elite Counter-Terrorism Unit (CTU) officers embody
  the essence of strength,
  precision, and patriotism. Their presence alone tells a story — one of sacrifice,
  discipline, and unwavering readiness to confront threats that endanger peace and stability.
 </p>
 <!-- second paragraph -->
 <p>  The CTU’s mission extends beyond visible operations;
   it represents Ghana’s deep commitment to safeguarding its people and
   upholding global standards of counter-terrorism excellence. Trained to
   operate under extreme pressure,
   these officers stand as a silent but formidable force — always alert,
   always prepared.
 </p>
<!-- third paragrapgh -->
 <p> Each uniform, each weapon, and each tactical formation in this image reflects
   countless hours of training, teamwork, and strategic coordination.
   Behind their calm yet commanding posture lies a sense of
   duty that goes far beyond personal
   ambition — it is about defending a
   nation’s integrity and securing its future.
 </p>
<!-- fourth paragraph -->
  <p>In an age where terrorism evolves with
    technology and borders blur in the digital world, the CTU’s adaptability and
    collaboration with global allies place Ghana among nations prepared for modern
    security challenges. Their courage is not loud —
    it is deliberate, disciplined, and deeply patriotic.
  </p>
<!-- six paragraph -->
  <p>To every Ghanaian, this image is a reminder:
    freedom has defenders — and they wear the
    uniform of the Counter-Terrorism Unit.

  <p id="Second-story-link">In a defining moment of strength and solidarity, a Ghana Police
    Counter-Terrorism Unit (CTU) officer stands shoulder-to-shoulder with a U.S. Marine during the
    official visit of the Vice President of the United States to Ghana. The image, taken on duty,
    captures more than two uniforms — it tells a story of unity, discipline, and shared global
    responsibility.</p>

   <p>The CTU, known for its precision and readiness, represents Ghana’s unwavering commitment to combating
   terrorism and maintaining peace within its borders and beyond. This collaboration with U.S. forces
   underscores the value of international partnerships in today’s complex security landscape — where
   intelligence, coordination, and trust are the most powerful weapons.</p>

   <p>Beyond the tactical gear and silent vigilance, this photo reflects mutual respect between nations
   that stand for peace and global stability. It reminds every Ghanaian officer that the call to duty
   is not just about protecting a nation, but about contributing to a safer world.</p>

   <p>As global threats evolve, the men and women of Ghana’s CTU continue to train
   ,adapt, and respond with excellence — embodying the motto of readiness,
   professionalism, and
   courage under pressure.
