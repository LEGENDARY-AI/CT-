 <p>In a defining moment of strength and solidarity,
     a Ghana Police Counter-Terrorism Unit (CTU) officer stands shoulder-to-shoulder with
     a U.S. Marine during the official visit of the Vice President of the United States to
     Ghana. The image, taken on duty, captures more than two uniforms — it tells a story

    a U.S. Marine during the official visit of the Vice President of the United States to
     Ghana. The image, taken on duty, captures more than two uniforms — it tells a story
     of unity, discipline, and shared global responsibility.</p>

<p>The CTU, known for its precision and readiness, represents Ghana’s unwavering commitment
 to combating terrorism and maintaining peace within its borders and beyond.
  This collaboration with U.S. forces underscores the value of international
   partnerships in today’s complex security landscape — where intelligence, coordination,
    and trust are the most powerful weapons.</p>

Beyond the tactical gear and silent vigilance, this photo reflects mutual
 respect between nations that stand for peace and global stability.
  It reminds every Ghanaian officer that the call to duty is not just about
  protecting a nation, but about contributing to a safer world.

 <p>As global threats evolve, the men and women of Ghana’s
CTU continue to train, adapt, and respond with excellence — embodying
 the motto of readiness, professionalism, and courage under pressure.
