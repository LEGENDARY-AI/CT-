<div class="Story">
 <p>The Ghana Police Service Counter-Terrorism Unit (CTU) successfully
     concluded an intensive Raid Course conducted in collaboration with
     a team of instructors from the French Armed Forces. This specialized
     training program was designed to enhance the operational readiness, precision,
     and coordination of CTU officers
     in high-risk intervention and counter-terrorism operations.
  </p>

  <p>Under the supervision of senior CTU Commanders, the course focused on advanced
     raid tactics, room-clearing procedures, coordinated assaults, hostage
     rescue techniques, and operational planning under pressure. The training emphasized both individual
     skill development and cohesive teamwork — essential elements in neutralizing modern security threats.
  </p>

  <p>
    The presence of the French instructors underscored the importance of international
     cooperation and knowledge exchange in strengthening national counter-terrorism
     frameworks. Through this partnership, CTU officers gained exposure to diverse
     tactical doctrines and shared experiences from real-world missions,
     further refining their capacity to respond to evolving threats with
     professionalism and precision.
  </p>

  <p>In the closing ceremony, CTU Commanders commended participants for
     their discipline, resilience, and commitment to upholding the Unit’s values of courage, excellence, and service to the nation. The collaborative effort reflects Ghana’s continued dedication to maintaining a highly trained, globally
     connected counter-terrorism force ready to safeguard peace and stability
     within its borders and beyond.
